# mp3_arranger

I subscribe to 2-3 podcasts that distribute free songs. The mp3 files for these podcasts have several 
problems that make them difficult to use as songs long term. For example, there are 
tags that identify them as podcasts, which causes iTunes to treat them differently. The
artist and track names are also assigned incorrectly. This script fixes the tags to 
make it easier to keep the song permanently and find it easily in music players.
